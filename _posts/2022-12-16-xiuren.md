This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:


{% assign image_files = site.static_files | where: "image13", true %}
{% for myimage in image_files %}
  ![](https://raw.iqiq.io/webcrack4/jekyll/wtf{{ myimage.path }})
{% endfor %}
